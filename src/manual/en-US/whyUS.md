## Building a "Goal-Oriented" Team
### Utilizing our product, you can:
1. **Task Cards** are no longer just a simple list; you can choose from "Task, Memo, Checklist" types based on the needs of the task;
2. **Focus on Individual Messages**, in discussions, each message is a topic. You can participate through replies and handle them centrally in "Discussion Topics";
3. **Say Goodbye to the Sea of Messages**, every "Task," "Todo," "Plan," "Article," and in the future, even more content prototypes, will be associated with discussion topics by default, eliminating the need to search for related discussion content in the main discussion window. For example, you can directly access the associated "Discussion Topic" from the card;
4. **Focus More**, you can choose "Focus Mode," which only displays tasks "relevant to you" on the interface;
5. **Isolation**: For "external members," we have created a separate interface where, in addition to the "matters" they need to handle, they will not have visibility of any internal data;
6. **Balance**, within the "team," you can link "personal" matters, thus achieving: adding your own "matters" to "matters" without affecting others. For example: You are involved in a "task," and to complete this task, the "matters" you personally need to do, you can add a "related todo." It is invisible to others, and you can manage it like your own "todo," while it can also be displayed when you view the related "task." Currently, you can create related "todos" in the "project," "card" kanban;
7. **Feedback Collection**, we allow you to share a "card" and choose the "content" you want to share. Others can access this content through a "share code" or "share link," and can submit "feedback" anonymously.
