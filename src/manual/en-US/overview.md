## Overview
TPBase is committed to enhancing the collaboration efficiency of "goal-driven" teams. To achieve this goal, we have carefully prepared the following features:

### Collaborative Kanban:
You can create cards of three types: "Tasks," "Memos," and "Todos."
#### Differences:
- Tasks: The main content supports rich text editing, allowing you to describe tasks more systematically;
- Memos: Quickly add a memo entry;
- Todos: Multi-level to-do lists with support for grouping.

#### Common Features:
- All have complete functions of task kanban, to-dos, documents, files, and planning.

### Document:
Simple single-layer Markdown document support, allowing you to create concise Markdown documents to convey information more clearly to your team.

### File:
Team cloud storage functionality.

### Planning:
Team planning calendar.

### Classroom:
A variant form of the team kanban, presenting content to members in the form of a classroom.

### Lens:
A variant form of the team kanban created for film and television production teams, organizing to-do tasks in the form of shots.
